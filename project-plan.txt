Overview
Design and implement a prompt engineering system that analyzes Twitter data to generate personality insights and create effective chatbot prompts.

Required Resources
- Twitter data from selected profiles (you may find the raw JSON here)
- Access to three models:
  - Anthropic's Claude
  - Midnight Miqu 70B (https://huggingface.co/sophosympatheia/Midnight-Miqu-70B-v1.0)
  - Model of your choice

1. Process and clean the raw Twitter JSONs, keeping only meaningful data on the profiles, e.g. things like a profile’s tweets, a profile’s number of likes, and other metadata provided in the JSONs.

2. Using the cleaned data, design prompts all three models for three distinct outputs:
     - A personality psychoanalysis
     - Should capture unique traits and quirks
     - Include in the prompt, data from step 1 about their popular tweets and opinions
     - Written in a casual, entertaining, insightful style

   - A chat system prompt
     - Capture the essence of the personality
     - Include interaction style & chat samples
     - Define behavioral boundaries
     - Make it actually usable for deployment

   - Creative output of your choice
     - Examples: insecurity analysis of the profile, a sitcom written in the style of their tweets,    an ai agent 
     - Document your approach

Technical Requirements
- Python-based implementation
- Use local model solution like OobaBooga hosted on a rented GPU to test prompts (reach out if you need us to help with this step, for example acquiring a GPU)
- Clear documentation of prompt strategies
- Proper error handling
- Example outputs from all models

Deliverables
1. GitHub repository containing:
   - Data processing code
   - Prompt generation system (things like instruction template)
   - The Prompts
   - Model interaction code
   - Example outputs

We will have a call to go through design decisions you made along the way.

Evaluation Criteria
We will evaluate based on:
1. Prompt design creativity and effectiveness
2. Understanding of model differences
3. Quality of output analysis
4. Technical implementation
5. Walk through of your thought process
