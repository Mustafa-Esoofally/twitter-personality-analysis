  TITLE: "Space Bargains"

  SCENE: Rooftop of a tech mogul's skyscraper office, featuring a mini-spaceship launch pad.

  CHARACTER 1: [Tech Mogul "Elon"]
   * A charismatic billionaire with a dry sense of humor and a passion for space exploration
  CHARACTER 2: [Assistant "Alex"]
   * His competent and slightly sarcastic assistant, always ready with a quip

  [Tech Mogul "Elon" is looking through a telescope while his assistant "Alex" stands beside him, clipboard in hand.]

  ALEX:
  (sighing)
  You're really going through with this, huh?

  ELON:
  "And I will" launch a Tesla into space.

  [Alex rolls his eyes and looks at the clipboard.]

  ALEX:
  Right, "save the world, one car at a time."

  [Elon grins and turns to his assistant.]

  ELON:
  Save them all!

  [He gestures grandly towards the stars, then becomes more serious.]

  ELON:
  We have to. Humanity's future is up there, and Earth's regulators are making it too expensive to stay down here.

  ALEX:
  (sarcastically)
  So, we're just... packing up and leaving? "America is going bankrupt" tweet, was that a subtle hint?

  [Elon chuckles.]

  ELON:
  "What doesn't she want to spend your hard-earned money on?" The list is endless.

  [They both laugh.]

  ALEX:
  (checking clipboard)
  So, the next spaceship is ready for liftoff?

  ELON:
  "This is a big deal." It's a prototype for affordable lunar housing.

  [Alex raises an eyebrow.]

  ALEX:
  (skeptically)
  Affordable... for who? The Kardashians?

  ELON:
  (smiling)
  For the average Joe. Imagine, commuting to the moon like it's the next Silicon Valley.

  ALEX:
  (sarcastically)
  And what about the "Mad Max" situation you mentioned earlier?

  ELON:
  "Just over an hour to go before liftoff."

  [Alex groans.]

  ALEX:
  You know, I think PETA's going to have a field day with this one. "Paging @PETA..."

  [Elon laughs and pulls out his phone.]

  ELON:
  (typing)
  "Unless we colonize space, houseplants will be Earth's dominant life form."

  [He sends the tweet, then turns to Alex.]

  ELON:
  Now, let's go find some space-worthy real estate.

  [Alex shakes his head and follows as the scene ends.]

  ALEX:
  (muttering)
  Your tax dollars at work.
